# Start a Tetra

Anyone can start a Tetra. You don't need to get anyone else's permission or endorsement. You don't need to have any special community organizing skills (yet). All you have to do is declare that youâ€™re starting a Tetra for your city or town or neighborhood or friend group and then start doing stuff under that banner. Hosting a weekly event is a good way to get the ball rolling, but you can do whatever makes sense for your Tetra.

### Name and logo

You can use the name "Tetra [your city/town/neighborhood/friend group]" or choose a different name if you want. You can generate a logo using the [Sierpinski logo generator](/logo-generator) or make a custom logo yourself or just skip the logo.

### Webpage on tetracity.net

To get your Tetra listed on this website with a dedicated page, send an email to [dan.allison@protonmail.com](mailto:dan.allison@protonmail.com) or open a pull request on the [tetracity.net GitHub repo](https://github.com/danallison/tetracity.net). This step is not required but is _highly encouraged_ because it helps people find your Tetra and it avoids the confusion of having multiple Tetras in the same city using the same name.

### Level up

If you want to level up your community organizing skills, check out [Microsolidarity](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/) and [Fractal's Campus Accelerator Program](https://fractalcampus.com/) for knowledge and guidance.
