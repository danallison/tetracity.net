# Tetra Global

Tetra Global is the online hub that connects across local groups within the larger network. The Tetra Global Discord server is a good default starting point for finding people and resources in the network, for coordinating across cities, and for getting support with starting your own Tetra in your city.

Currently there is a job seekers group led by [Dan Allison](https://x.com/danallison) that is organized through Tetra Global, and there are plans to host similar groups in the future.

To join the Discord, reach out to [Dan Allison](https://x.com/danallison) for an invite.
