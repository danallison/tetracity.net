# Tetra [City]

<img src="/city-logo.png" width="200px">

__Tetra [City]__ (e.g. Tetra Seattle) is an organizational pattern for bringing online connections down to Earth as in-person local scenes and communities.

Anyone can start a Tetra. All you have to do is declare that you're starting a Tetra for your city or town or neighborhood or friend group and then start doing stuff under that banner. __Tetra [City]__ is simply a convenient default name, [logo](/logo-generator), and social template for a group identity that helps you build the local scene and community you want to see in the world.

The concept of a Tetra was originally inspired by the concept of a [neighborhood campus](https://fractalcampus.com/) trailblazed by [Fractal NYC](https://fractalnyc.com/). Tetra also draws inspiration from practices like [Microsolidarity](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/) and events like [Vibecamp](https://vibe.camp/) that bring online connections into offline physical space.

## What does "Tetra" mean?

### 1. Greater than the sum of its parts

Tetra is Greek for the number four. The number four represents the middle triangle that emerges when you arrange three triangles to form a larger triangle. That middle triangle made from empty space is what makes the larger triangle greater than the sum of its parts. When you apply this architecture recursively, you get the famous Sierpinski triangle, which is the design that the [Tetra logo generator](/logo-generator) outputs.

### 2. Expanded vision

Tetrachromacy is a genetic condition in which individuals have four types of cone cells in their eyes, rather than the typical three. People with tetrachromacy can see a much wider range of colors than the typical person. People with tetrachromacy see things that other people don't see. The idea of __Tetra [City]__ is part of a greater vision of what's possible on Spaceship Earth. Not everyone has this vision yet, but those of us who do can clearly see the vision spreading.

### 3. Unblocking

The game of Tetris is a helpful metaphor for understanding the challenge of bringing online connections down to Earth in a specific geographic location. You must figure out how to deal with physical constraints that are not present online. But if you succeed, then your scene and community become unblocked and capable of supporting everyone.

### 4. Spontaneously synchronizing

Tetra fish are a type of schooling fish that synchronize their movements spontaneously, similar to other animal species like birds that move as flocks. In the context of __Tetra [City]__, we synchronize spontaneously through "yes, and"-ing each other's ideas and contributions. Improv is the basic organizing principle.
